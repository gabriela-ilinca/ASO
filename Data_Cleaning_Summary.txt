DATA CLEANING SUMMARY

Data Preparation & Cleaning Steps:

• Combined FY23 and FY24 ticket datasets into unified master dataset (73,534 total records)
• Reshaped demographics data from long to wide format (handled duplicate entries by keeping most recent)
• Merged ticket data with patron demographics using account ID
• Loaded event dates from season events list and matched to tickets using event codes
• Normalized event names (stripped whitespace, standardized formats) to ensure accurate matching
• Added college pass tickets and flagged with is_college_pass indicator
• Calculated days_before_event metric (purchase timing relative to event date)
• Excluded comp tickets from revenue analysis (filtered comp = 'Y')
• Generated comprehensive data quality report validating data completeness and ranges

Result: Clean, unified master dataset ready for pricing and revenue analysis with complete event, patron, and timing information.
